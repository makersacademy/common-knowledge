# Common Knowledge

Welcome! As a student at Makers, you're part of our [community of learners](https://early.khanacademy.org/open-ended/). It's one of our most valuable resources; all our students since [we recorded it](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iab67so3To5neYnwY6IcF7VX3oLt9WvR2xun4eTxsxo/edit#gid=0) consistently say that you enable and accelerate each others' learning.

This repository is a tool for you to use as much as you need.

## You might be here to
- [search](https://github.com/makersacademy/common-knowledge/issues?q=) if your question has already been asked and answered
- [ask a new question](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=student-question.md&title=)
- answer an open question
- contribute to this repository!

### Search!

Questions are stored as [repository issues](https://github.com/makersacademy/common-knowledge/issues).

[Learn how to use advanced operators](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) to help you to filter the issues to ones relevant to you. Add a search query as a bookmark to your browser to access them quickly.

NB: Remember to upvote/comment on an issue if you're also having it so issues can get prioritised by number of people it's affecting. It's likely to be resolved faster!


### Ask!

1. Remember to [search](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow/issues?q=) for your question first, using search parameters for open and closed questions and keywords. 
2. If a question already exists - comment on it and upvote it!
3. If it doesn't exist, open a [new issue](https://github.com/makersacademy/slack-overflow/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=student-question.md&title=). Use labels to help!
4. Spend time thinking about what information to provide in your question. Here are some [resources](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) to help. Remember, [subjective questions or unscoped](http://stackoverflow.com/help/dont-ask) questions won't get a speedy reply.
5. When you feel it's answered, close the issue!
6. If it takes a while, Slack a coach the link to the question - but be judicious when you choose to boost the response time, this strategy might not always work!

### Answer!

1. Definitely post a solution to the problem if you figure something out! And then celebrate, maybe with lots of emojis?
2. Read this [guide](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-answer) to answering questions, in short - make sure you've read and understood the question!

Take some time to investigate and answer your peers' questions! It's valuable evidence of demonstrating your understanding of the topic, and can give you an opportunity for some fun further learning!

### Contribute!

Spot a typo? Want to suggest some resources? It's as easy as [opening a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and then slacking a coach a link to it.
